As computing systems become increasingly larger, more complex, distributed, and integrated, Big Data technologies and services are ever more vital. IEEE BigDataService 2022 provides an internationally leading forum for researchers and practitioners in academia and industry to exchange innovative ideas and share latest results, experiences and lessons learned in this crucial domain.
The conference will take place in the San Francisco Bay Area (California, USA) on the 22nd-25th of August 2022, and will consist of a main track and special tracks. The conference also welcomes workshop proposals and seeks the submission of high-quality papers limited to up to 8 pages (IEEE format) in length. All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings. Selected papers will be invited for extension and published in journals (SCI-Index).
BigDataService 2022 is part of the CISOSE 2022 congress, and it will be co-located with IEEE SOSE 2022, IEEE MobileCloud 2022, IEEE DAPPS 2022, and IEEE AITest 2022.
